# Info screen 
This is the assigment of Eficode Summer job. 

### What I did
- The info screen displays the timetable of public transportation which will leave from the stops near the Eficode headquarter in a short time.
- Use HSL open data interface, use Graphql as the query language
- Publish the solution in Heroku ([demo](https://eficodepreassignment.herokuapp.com/))
- Use Docker for packaging the application. The image is in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yumol/eficodepreassignment)
- Use React
- Use Robot Framework for user interface testing (test if the timetable shows stops near the Eficode headquarter)
- Use Semantic UI as UI framework
- Use eslint
